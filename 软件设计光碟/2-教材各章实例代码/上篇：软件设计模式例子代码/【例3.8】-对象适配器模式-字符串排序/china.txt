Turkey has assured the Iraqi government and the U.S. military that the operation would be limited to attacks on rebels. 
But the Kurds have expressed concern that civilians could be caught in the crossfire.
The Kurdish parliament met Tuesday in a special session and unanimously approved a measure authorizing the peshmerga to defend themselves and the Kurdish region if they were attacked by Turkish troops.
It also called on the Turkish government for compensation for material losses sustained as a result of the incursion, according to Kurdish lawmaker Sardar Harki.
